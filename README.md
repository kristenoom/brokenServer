# BROKEN SERVER CHALLENGE

### The Backstory

You were just hired as a Senior Developer for a Company called Nodemon Servers. You hosted your very first huddle and your team of developers handed you a HOT mess of code said they can't seem to get the server working.

1. Clone Repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Make sure that your postgres password in `db.js` is correct
4. Create `'brokenServer'` in pgAdmin 4 or 5
5. Run `'nodemon app.js'`
6. Debug!

There are ten errors to find. Five compile issues, five logic issues.

Happy hacking!
